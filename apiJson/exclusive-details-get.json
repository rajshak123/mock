Liquidity risk - The company facing difficulty in selling an asset is termed as Liquidity Risk. In the case of bonds too selling a bond below its indicated value may expose the investor to liquidity risk. When an investor wants to sell a bond prior to the maturity date, he is concerned with whether or not the bid price from broker or dealers is near enough to the indicated value of the issue.\nD.
